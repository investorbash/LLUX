            <p>
                L'LUX is all about simplifying beauty. We’re committed to creating products and a community that inspire
                you to be your most confident self. We develop only the essentials, products that are easy-to-use and 
                multifunctional, that work for your on-the-go lifestyle, where simplicity and efficiency are key. Launching
                in 2020, our founders wanted to create a space that cut through an overwhelming market with 100’s of products,
                and gave our community the products they were looking for, simplified.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bringing world-first formulas and products to market, we’re leading a new world of beauty; we’re always vegan, 
                cruelty and fragrance free and proud to be Leaping Bunny certified. All our products have been developed to suit
                 all skin tones and types, with added ingredients, such as Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide and Peptides, to give you
                  even more out of your beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
                At L'LUX we are more than a beauty brand. Our community are our biggest supporters, that’s why we are always listening
                 and developing ways in which we can give our community more. We’re bringing you into our L'LUX lifestyle, where we
                  believe in simplifying your routine so you have more time to live your life and do the things you love.
